      "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is a science fiction novel by French author Jules Verne, first published in 1870. The novel follows Captain Nemo and his submarine, the Nautilus, as they travel 20,000 leagues under the sea. The story is divided into three parts, each focusing on different aspects of the journey, wonders of the deep sea, technology, and freedom. The 1871 Chelebourg edition of the text served as the basis for the translation, and includes 42 illustrations, published for the first time with Hetzel's illustrations and includes notes and a new introduction. Despite criticisms of technical accuracy, the novel is widely regarded as a classic of science fiction and has been translated into numerous languages. Jules Verne is also known for other works such as The Mutineers of the Bounty and the novel has inspired numerous adaptations, including films and games.\n"
